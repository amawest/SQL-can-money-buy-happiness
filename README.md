# SQL and Seaborn: Can Money Buy You Happiness? 

## About data
The datasets I used for this project were taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). I used 2017 population data from the UN in tandem with the 2017 World Happiness Report. 

## About Project
This project was done solely on the IBM db2 Cloud and Jupyter Notesbooks. You can find the queries under organizing_tables.sql.
